# Hello ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Drew]

I'm a product manager that is passionate about deep interative experiences, problem-solving, and games like Tic-Tac-Toe.

## Let's Play Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸŽ²

Here's the current board:

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
| X | O |   |
|   | X |   |
|   |   | O |

It's your turn! To make a move, open a new issue and tell me where you'd like to place your "X" or "O". Use the row and column identifiers to specify the cell. For example, "top-left" would refer to the first cell in the top row.

Or you can Tweet me your move at [@AndrewH03634070]([https://twitter.com/YourTwitterHandle](https://twitter.com/AndrewH03634070
